## [2.11.14] — 2026-07-20

### Added

- **`auto_finalize_single_tool` runtime option (AiNative)** — when the HOST classifies a turn as one whose outcome is a single staged write, `AiNativeRuntime` returns a final response with the host's templated closing text (`auto_finalize_message`) after the first successful write instead of spending another full planner round-trip just to phrase a sentence. Guarded: exactly one outcome this turn (via an explicit per-turn counter), the outcome succeeded and is write-shaped, the plan declared no further `steps`, the task frame reports `completed`, and — when supplied — the tool is on the `auto_finalize_tools` allowlist.
- **Single-shot tool repeat guard (AiNative)** — a tool the host declared single-shot via `auto_finalize_tools` that is re-planned after already succeeding this turn now finalizes the turn instead of re-executing. Measured host pathology: a staging tool returned "preview ready — task COMPLETE" and the planner re-called it up to 5× with cosmetically varying arguments (so an exact-argument check would not catch it), burning the whole step budget on ~7s model rounds and creating a duplicate preview row per repeat — a one-op edit turn took 48s. Deliberately scoped to the host-declared list: repeating an identical call is legitimate in general (re-check/poll/progress loops). Covered by `AiNativeRuntimeTest::test_single_shot_tool_repeat_finalizes_instead_of_re_executing` and `::test_repeat_guard_ignores_tools_the_host_did_not_declare_single_shot`.
- **Turn deadline (AiNative)** — `ai-agent.ai_native.turn_deadline_seconds` (or per-run `options.turn_deadline_seconds`) bounds the SUM of a turn's sequential planner/tool round-trips. A synchronous HTTP turn exceeding PHP's `max_execution_time` previously died as an uncatchable FatalError mid-Guzzle, leaving the client hanging with no terminal event; the loop now checks an absolute wall-clock deadline between steps and returns a typed, relayable failure (`error_code: turn_deadline_exceeded`). Unset = derive from `max_execution_time` minus a 20s margin (0/CLI = unlimited).

### Changed

- **Prompt-size: snapshot outcome compaction** — `ai-agent.ai_native.snapshot_compact_outcomes` (default ON) collapses byte-identical `recent_outcomes` entries in the rendered context snapshot to one entry plus `{"repeats":N}` and caps each entry's `display` strings (~200 chars). Render-time only; the persisted state is untouched.
- **Prompt-size: replayed-history turn-context stripping** — `ai-agent.ai_native.history_strip_turn_context` (default ON) keeps only the text after a host's `User request…:` fence marker in REPLAYED user history, so a prior turn's stale context block is not re-billed on every later turn (and cannot mislead the planner).

### Fixed

- **Cap-proof per-turn outcome accounting** — `recent_outcomes` is capped at 12, so in long sessions the cap trims from the front mid-turn and any `outcomes_at_turn_start`-based slice mis-counts. The runtime now maintains an explicit `turn_outcome_count` / `last_turn_outcome` pair (in-memory, dropped cross-turn by the state-store allowlist), used by both the auto-finalize guard and the loop-exhaustion salvage.

## [2.9.3] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **Loop exhaustion no longer denies completed work** — when the agent loop ends without a parseable final turn from the model but the task frame reports the objective COMPLETED (a write tool succeeded this turn), `AiNativeRuntime` now returns a final response carrying the last successful tool outcome (`data.last_tool_outcome`) instead of "I need more information to continue." — which read as failure to the user when their request had in fact been fulfilled. Successful lookups mid-flow still lead to the planned ask, and sub-agent runs keep their own richer `tool_result_fallback` salvage (guarded by the task-frame status condition).

## [2.9.2] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **Caller run metadata now reaches tool contexts** — `LaravelAgentProcessor::process()` merges the caller-supplied `options['metadata']` into the tool-visible `UnifiedActionContext->metadata` each turn. Application tools previously only saw runtime-managed keys (`ai_native`, `conversation_context_metrics`), forcing hosts to build side-channels for per-run scoping (tenant/workspace/page/draft identifiers). Caller values refresh stale persisted copies of the same keys; runtime-managed keys are unaffected. Covered by `ConversationHistoryHardeningTest::test_caller_run_metadata_is_threaded_into_the_tool_visible_context`.

## [2.9.1] — 2026-06-10

### Added

- **`proactive` runtime option (AiNative)** — `AiNativePromptBuilder::build()` honours a new `proactive` option (mirrors the `force_rag` pattern): when set, an autonomy instruction is spliced before the `Return JSON only.` anchor biasing the model to act on build/create/compose/design/generate requests using the context snapshot (catalog guardrails, resolved design system) instead of interviewing the user for direction it already has. Off by default — the agent keeps its clarify-first disposition unless the caller opts in per run. Covered by `AiNativePromptBuilderTest::test_prompt_biases_toward_acting_when_proactive_is_set`.

## [2.2.39] — 2026-06-01

### Changed

- **Stateless multi-turn dedup guard** — `hydrateConversationHistory` now skips `addUserMessage` when the current user message already appears as the last entry in the replayed `conversation_history`, preventing duplicate user turns in stateless multi-turn flows.
- **Conversation history hard-cap** — `hydrateConversationHistory` slices the replayed history to the last `ai-agent.context_compaction.max_messages` entries (default 12) before assigning it to the context, preventing oversized client-replayed threads from bypassing the compactor and ballooning prompt cost.
- **Null content normalisation** — `null` content on assistant messages (OpenAI-style `tool_calls` entries) is normalised to `''` during hydration so downstream code never receives a `null` content value.
- **Multipart/vision content flattening** — array-typed `content` (multipart / vision turns) is now flattened by extracting `text`-typed parts during both `hydrateConversationHistory` and `ConversationContextCompactor::sanitizeMessages`, eliminating the PHP `Array to string conversion` warning and the literal string `'Array'` appearing in prompts. `historyChars` now uses `json_encode` to estimate array content length safely.
- **Throwable catch widening** — both `askAI()` and `routeThroughPipeline()` now catch `\Throwable` instead of `\Exception`, so PHP `TypeError` and `ValueError` from `IntentRouter` or the routing pipeline propagate into the graceful fallback path rather than escaping to the HTTP layer.
- **Clean RAG-to-orchestrator reroute** — `AgentConversationService::executeSearchRAG` now unsets `conversation_history` from `rerouteOptions` before the exit reroute call, removing stale key noise and making the reroute path clean.
- **Configurable conversational max tokens** — `AgentConversationService::executeConversational` now reads `maxTokens` from `$options['max_tokens'] ?? config('ai-agent.conversational.max_tokens', 200)` instead of a hard-coded `200`, letting operators and callers tune response length without overriding the class.
- **Caller contract documented** — `hydrateConversationHistory` now has a docblock explicitly stating that `role` values must be lowercase (`user`, `assistant`, `system`, `tool`) and that entries with unrecognised casing are silently dropped.

### Added

- **ConversationHistoryHardeningTest** — 12 new PHPUnit/Pest unit tests covering dedup guard, history cap, null normalisation, multipart content flattening (hydration and compactor), `Throwable` fallback, invalid-role dropping, and edge cases (missing/empty/non-array history, missing content key).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **AI-native agent runtime** — added a package-wide tool loop where the model decides intent, tool use, follow-up questions, confirmations, and final responses while Laravel enforces validation, scope, approval, audit, and trusted tool-result authority.
- **Learned design generation** — added `Engine::learn()->generateDesign()` and `ai:design` so the package can generate HTML/Markdown design artifacts from scoped learned context.
- **Learned design fidelity** — `ai:design` now includes bounded raw source context, optional neutral `media_url` support for full-bleed learned media bands, and sanitizes source brand/font leakage from generated artifacts.
- **Learn layer** — added `Engine::learn()`, `ai:learn`, scoped SQL storage for learned sources/items, optional vector-store indexing, and a getdesign adapter for URL and curated `DESIGN.md` slug imports.
- **Peer sub-agent conversations** — added `SubAgentConversationService` and `ai:test-sub-agent-chat` so two configured sub-agents can alternate turns over a long-lived session, persist shared context, and run deterministic or live provider-backed checks.

### Changed

- **AI-driven skills** — `run_skill` now delegates to the AI-native runtime, passing skills and tools as capability context. The old package-coded `SkillFlowRunner` path has been removed.
- **Action tool cleanup** — removed the old action-draft workflow tools from the built-in registry. Use concrete tools or `ActionBackedTool` classes for write capabilities.
- **Model tool config naming** — renamed `AutonomousModelConfig` to `ModelToolConfig` to match the current skill/tool architecture.
- **AI-native suggested tool continuations** — when a confirmed tool returns `current_payload`, `missing_fields`, and `suggested_tools`, the runtime can run safe lookup/search continuations and retry the already confirmed write instead of asking the user to manually route the next tool.
- **AI-native final-tool authority** — skills can declare `metadata.final_tool` or `metadata.final_tools`; the runtime will not accept a final answer for that skill until one declared final tool has executed successfully.
- **AI-native parser tolerance** — direct tool-name JSON such as `{"action":"find_customer","query":"ACME"}` is normalized into a tool call with top-level fields as arguments.
- **AI-native pending write approvals** — configured continuation terms such as `create it`, `do it`, and `go ahead` now resume the active pending write confirmation instead of discarding it and starting a fresh tool attempt.
- **AI-native confirmation summaries** — write-tool confirmations now include a generic user-friendly summary of the pending tool payload before execution, with readable labels, hidden IDs, empty-value omission, and configurable redaction for sensitive fields.
- **AI-native computed confirmation totals** — confirmation summaries can now add line totals, subtotal, and total for common list-item payloads using configurable quantity and unit amount fields when a tool does not provide its own preview.
- **AI-native context intelligence** — tool results are normalized into generic outcomes, active task frames track pending confirmations and completed writes, prompts include compact context snapshots, lookup-resolvable values are pushed through available lookup tools before asking users, and repeated confirmed writes with the same payload are blocked from executing twice.
- **AI-native write-confirmation recovery** — free-text model approval questions for available write tools are rejected, retried, and can fall back to structured Laravel tool confirmations from the current task payload so follow-up `confirm` messages keep durable pending-tool state.

### Removed

- **Legacy collector runtime** — removed `DataCollector*`, `AutonomousCollector*`, collector DTOs, collector handlers, collector API/runtime wiring, and `autonomous_collectors` node metadata. Use structured collection for callback-based data capture or AI-native skills plus tools/actions for executable app workflows.
- **Legacy action-intake runtime** — removed the old draft/intake helpers and built-in action-flow tools (`ActionIntakeCoordinator`, `ActionPayloadExtractor`, `ActionManager`, action draft tools, and related tests). Use concrete tools, `ActionBackedTool`, `ActionRegistry`, and `ActionOrchestrator`.

### Upgrade Notes

- Existing installs that already ran removed collector migrations may keep old database artifacts until the host app drops them. The package no longer reads `data_collector_configs`, `data_collector_states`, or `ai_nodes.autonomous_collectors`; remove those tables/columns in the host app if they are not used elsewhere.
- Replace custom model config classes extending `AutonomousModelConfig` with `ModelToolConfig`.

## [2.2.35] — 2026-05-18

### Changed

- **Conversation transcript naming** — extracted transcript/session history behavior into `ConversationTranscriptService` and removed the old `ConversationService` compatibility alias.
- **Config-cache cleanup** — moved the env-backed default config tree into `config/ai-engine-defaults.php`; runtime source files no longer call `env()` directly.
- **Chat transcript persistence** — `ChatService` now persists the user and assistant turn after the agent runtime returns when transcript history is enabled.
- **Agent response presentation** — chat can now return bullet/numbered response points as arrays and include generic next-step suggestions from registered actions, skills, and tools.
- **Modern provider passthrough** — normal `AIRequest` and `EngineProxy` flows now support `withProviderOptions()` for provider-specific request fields across OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, OpenRouter, and FAL-compatible media payloads.
- **OpenAI Responses state** — OpenAI Responses calls can remember and reuse previous response ids per conversation when explicitly enabled.
- **Provider tool versioning** — Anthropic hosted tool type names and beta headers are configurable while preserving existing defaults.
- **Realtime and MCP/App bridges** — added a realtime tool broker for provider realtime tool calls and an MCP/App-compatible adapter for registered tools and skills.
- **Realtime and MCP/App HTTP APIs** — `/api/v1/ai/mcp/tools`, `/api/v1/ai/mcp/tools/{tool}/call`, and `/api/v1/ai/realtime/tools/dispatch` expose the bridge to host clients and brokers.
- **Observability hooks and exporters** — traces and evaluations can now export through configured `ObservabilityExporter` classes, including built-in HTTP, OpenTelemetry OTLP, LangSmith, and log exporters.
- **OpenAI Responses live smoke** — added an opt-in billed live test for remembered `previous_response_id` continuation.
- **Structured chat collection** — chat can now collect a target JSON object from conversation, ask for missing fields in the user's language, confirm, close the session, and call an HTTP or Laravel-event callback.
- **Structured collection field helpers** — `StructuredCollectionDefinition` now includes typed helpers such as `addText()`, `addEmail()`, `addDate()`, `addSelect()`, `addMultiSelect()`, and related UI field builders while keeping `addField()` as the generic escape hatch.
- **Localized collection field presentation** — structured collection responses now include `collection.fields` with required state, UI type, formats, and localized select-like option labels while storing canonical option values.
- **Structured collection previews** — structured collection can optionally return safe package-rendered HTML, component, or schema previews with external CSS/JS assets for chat UIs.
- **Focused SDK documentation** — split the overloaded SDK compatibility page into focused guides for provider tools, structured collection, frontend previews, vector stores, realtime/observability, chat actions, API reference, and security.
- **AgentChat engine validation** — API validation now accepts any configured or built-in engine instead of only OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini.
- **Provider facade shortcuts** — `Engine::openai()`, `Engine::openrouter()`, `Engine::fal()`, and the other built-in provider shortcuts now return the same fluent proxy as `Engine::engine('provider')`.

## [2.2.34] — 2026-05-17

### Added

- **Token-efficient agent memory** — added durable scoped conversation memories with repository, DTOs, prompt builder, extractor, optional semantic index integration, and docs for long-running chat sessions.
- **OpenRouter multimodal coverage** — expanded OpenRouter support for routed chat, streaming, structured/tool calls, model catalog metadata, embeddings, image generation, TTS, STT, STS, multimodal chat inputs, and optional free/cheap model routing.
- **Live provider matrix coverage** — added/expanded live checks for text, image, queued FAL video, TTS, transcription, agent flow, AIMedia persistence, and OpenRouter routed features.

### Fixed

- **Live agent JSON output with multilingual responses** — `ai:test-real-agent --json` now builds UTF-8 safe excerpts and uses invalid UTF-8 substitution, preventing Arabic or other multibyte responses from collapsing command JSON to a blank line.
- **Live matrix JSON parsing** — live tests can now decode command JSON even when host applications print boot diagnostics before the command payload.
- **Optional Neo4j live checks** — live matrix GraphRAG now reports an unreachable Neo4j Query API endpoint as a skipped infrastructure dependency unless `AI_ENGINE_LIVE_REQUIRE_ALL=true` is used.

---

## [2.2.33] — 2026-05-17

### Added

- **PexelsEngineDriver** — new image-search driver backed by the Pexels API, with `PEXELS` constant in `EngineEnum` and `PEXELS_SEARCH` support wired through `EntityEnum`.
- **Text-to-speech provider coverage** — OpenAI now supports speech generation models (`gpt-4o-mini-tts`, `tts-1`, `tts-1-hd`) and Google Cloud Text-to-Speech is available through a dedicated `google_tts` driver.
- **HTTP health-check endpoint** — `GET /api/v1/ai/health` returns a structured package health payload consumable by load balancers and uptime monitors.
- **Anthropic model additions to EntityEnum**:
  - `CLAUDE_3_5_SONNET_20241022` (`claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`) — Oct 2024 snapshot of Claude 3.5 Sonnet.
  - `CLAUDE_3_7_SONNET` (`claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219`) — Claude 3.7 Sonnet (Feb 2025).
  - `CLAUDE_SONNET_4_5` (`claude-sonnet-4-5`) — Claude Sonnet 4.5.
  - `CLAUDE_OPUS_4_5` (`claude-opus-4-5`) — Claude Opus 4.5.
  - `CLAUDE_HAIKU_4_5` (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`) — Claude Haiku 4.5.
  - `CLAUDE_SONNET_4_6` (`claude-sonnet-4-6`) — Claude Sonnet 4.6.
  - `CLAUDE_OPUS_4_6` (`claude-opus-4-6`) — Claude Opus 4.6.
- **Google Gemini model additions to EntityEnum**:
  - `GEMINI_2_0_FLASH` (`gemini-2.0-flash`) — Gemini 2.0 Flash.
  - `GEMINI_2_0_FLASH_LITE` (`gemini-2.0-flash-lite`) — Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite.
  - `GEMINI_2_5_PRO` (`gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06`) — Gemini 2.5 Pro preview.
  - `GEMINI_2_5_FLASH` (`gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17`) — Gemini 2.5 Flash preview.
- **AIEngineFake assertion helper** — added `assertTemperatureUsed()` alongside the existing prompt, image, video, embedding, stream, model, engine, request-count, and last-request assertions.
- **Pest bootstrap** — `pestphp/pest` is declared for Laravel teams that prefer Pest syntax, while the existing PHPUnit suite remains supported.
- **Token estimation profiles** — `TokenCalculator` now detects latin, code, and CJK text profiles and exposes configurable character-per-token ratios through `ai-engine.token_estimation.profiles`.
- **Node and chunking coverage** — added dedicated tests for `NodeHttpClient` header forwarding and `ContentChunker` token-budget behavior.
- **Provider-hosted tool parity** — added provider tool descriptors for OpenAI hosted shell, apply patch, and provider skills; Gemini code execution now maps through the existing `CodeInterpreter` provider tool.
- **Gemini native TTS** — added Gemini TTS aliases and native `generateContent` audio handling. Inline PCM responses are wrapped as WAV files and stored through the media disk.
- **Realtime session options** — `RealtimeSessionConfig` now supports audio formats, turn detection, temperature, max response tokens, and provider-specific option passthrough.
- **Hosted artifact hardening** — remote artifact persistence now blocks private/local URLs by default and supports configured extension, MIME type, and size guards.

### Fixed

- **Committed PHPUnit configuration** — added `phpunit.xml.dist` so clean clones and GitHub Actions run the package suite instead of exiting with PHPUnit usage output.
- **Laravel 13 install compatibility** — widened Illuminate package constraints to include Laravel 13 after validating clean package discovery, config publishing, migrations, and health command execution.
- **CI determinism** — package tests now run in default order in CI and use `actions/checkout@v5`, removing random-order flakiness and the Node 20 checkout deprecation warning.
- **Job test isolation** — `ProcessAIRequestJobTest` now uses the lightweight package unit base so CI does not open nested SQLite transactions for non-database job assertions.
- **Test cache isolation** — package test bases now force rate-limit cache storage to the array driver, preventing Redis-dependent CI failures when Redis is not installed.
- **Broken facade auto-alias** — added `LaravelAIEngine\Facades\AIEngine` as an alias facade for the existing `Engine` facade so Laravel auto-alias resolution no longer crashes on boot.
- **Duplicate migration timestamps** — `create_ai_job_statuses_table` and `create_credit_packages_table` now use unique migration timestamps, so fresh installs have deterministic ordering.
- **AIEngineFake safe surface** — `AIEngineFake` no longer depends on real engine or memory services and overrides the public manager API used in tests.
- **OpenAI client resolution without a key** — OpenAI-backed services can now be resolved without `OPENAI_API_KEY`; a clear error is thrown only when an OpenAI resource is actually used.
- **Vectorizable save-time API guard** — AI-based field auto-detection is restricted to explicit indexing context, preventing ordinary model saves from triggering unexpected AI calls.
- **`vectorChatStream()` provider streaming** — the method now builds RAG context synchronously, then forwards provider stream chunks through the callback instead of returning one buffered response.

### Changed

- **`EngineEnum` is now a native PHP 8.1 backed enum** while preserving string constants for config and array-key usage.
- **Gemini media routing** now defaults `audio_generation` to native Gemini TTS and keeps `lyria-002` under `music_generation`.
- **Published config is annotated** instead of being a minimal delegation file, so apps get visible defaults for engines, token estimation, vector settings, cache, credits, and debug toggles.
- **Strict typing is enabled across source files** with `declare(strict_types=1);`.
- **Token calculations no longer use a single hardcoded characters-per-token heuristic** in base drivers, vector chunking, embedding fallback accounting, and vectorization truncation.

### Removed

- **Legacy collector public surface** — removed the standalone data-collector/autonomous-collector HTTP routes, controllers, facades, collector scaffold option, and collector discovery/test commands. New application flows should use agent chat with skills and tools.

### Notes

- `EntityEnum` intentionally remains a dynamic model value object because synced provider catalogs and database-backed models can contain arbitrary provider/model IDs that PHP native enums cannot represent as runtime cases.
